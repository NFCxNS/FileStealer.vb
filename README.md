# FileStealer.vb

I'm presenting you first FileStealer.VB I wrote 2 years ago. It recursively searches for files with certain names,zips them in one ZIP or RAR archive and uploades them on wanted FTP servers. It also has on option of sharing via USB. This code is uploaded for educational purposes only,I am not held responsible for further actions of potentional malicious users.
